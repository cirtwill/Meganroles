First to obtain output results using 'tests.py' run 'run_output' (i.e. in terminal 'bash run_output').

Second to get the frequencies of output in a format that is useable run 'run_frequencies' which will use 'frequencies.R' (i.e. in terminal 'bash run_frequencies')

Now you can use 'compile.py' to take all frequencies and put it into one file, skipping the header.


Now 'idweights.py' can be used to calculate the total frequency of each motif used. 


'contour_plot.R' can be used to create a contour plot using file with data in matrix format.
